# Readable API Server

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where I build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and the front-end portion of the project.

## Running the Project

Backend:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
	
Frontend:
	
* In another terminal window, install and start the frontend
    - `cd leitura`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
